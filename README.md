## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Vehicle Length, ground clearance and intercept provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
2. The slope of the linear model is not considered 0 because the pvalue is less than .05. 
3. The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r squared value is 0.7149, closer to 1.
